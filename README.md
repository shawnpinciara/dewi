# The Diatonical Electric Wind Instrument project
By [Shawn Pinciara](https://www.instagram.com/shawnpinciara) and [Romeo Gabriele](https://linktr.ee/garaggio).

## Idea:
What if instead of having one hands position per note (on all the canonic wind instruments) you could enconde it more efficiently? _That's the reason why we built the DEWI_.

The notes of one scale can be encoded with 3 buttons (2^3 for the white keys) and 1 button more (to add all the sharps); now add another identical 4 buttons row (to keep your other hand entertained) and you can control with one hand the scale, and the other one the key/signature in wich the scale is played... a Diatonical EWI (aka DEWI).

Mapping the 4 buttons to the 12 notes has been a challenge but we found a good balance between beeing logical and organic:
